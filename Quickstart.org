* Emacspeak Quickstart
The goal of this guide is to get Emacspeak running on your system and nothing
else, after that you have access to the Emacspeak manual via the info pages and
can of course play around and learn.

Once this document matures, I hope to contribute it as Quickstart.org in the
root of the Emacspeak project.

** Structure
This document comes in 3 major parts.

1. A minimal explanation of how emacspeak works, there is a far more detailed
   explanation in the manual, this is just enough to get you through getting it
   running.
2. Platform / Server specific guidance, in a high degree of detail, all the way
   from downloading emacspeak to setting up your init.el file.
3. Next steps, recommendations on next steps you should take.

** Contributing (to this document)
I want more contributions to this document, remember to assume as little as
possible and don't skip any steps. Will hopefully get more polished with more
people trying and correcting errors.

** What you need to know:
This is a vast simplification, but emacspeak is a combination of:
  - Elisp code that runs inside Emacs
  - A server process that runs does the Text-To-Speech (TTS)

Once you get the server process able to be run, which you can test at the
terminal by running it and typing commands, you are mostly there, after that
just a ittle config and you are off to the races.
