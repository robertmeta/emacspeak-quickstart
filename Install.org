This guide's only intent is to get you from zero to functional emacspeak.

No effort will be made to teach you how to use Emacspeak. 

* What you need to know
This is a vast simplification, just enough to help you debug issues and have a
general understanding.

Emacspeak has two major parts:
    1. Elisp code that runs inside Emacs
    2. A server process that runs does the Text-To-Speech (TTS)

The Elisp code in emacs will launch and communicate with the server process over
STDIN.

* Installl
Each section is complete, meaning if you are using Linux Mint, you only have to
look under the Linux Mint heading.
