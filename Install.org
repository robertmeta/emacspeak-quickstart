* Install Emacspeak

** How Emacspeak Works
This is a vast simplification, just enough to help you debug issues and have a
general understanding.

Emacspeak has two major parts:
  1. Elisp code that runs inside Emacs
  2. A server process that runs does the Text-To-Speech (TTS)

The Elisp code in emacs will launch and communicate with the server process over
STDIN.

Below you will find the steps to install Emacspeak with platform specific notes
and warnings in each section.
